      <p>My name is Cate Start (aka Cat Star on itch.io). I grew up with video games as a large part of my life; always fascinated by how things were made and how they worked, I was curious about the effort and dedication put into creating games. I found the combination of both artistic and technical skills very compelling, which motivated me to study games with the hopes of creating my own. Outside of game design and development I also love dance, music, creating art, and spending time with my cats.
